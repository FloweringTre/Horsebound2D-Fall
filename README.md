 Stardew meets Ranch of Rivershine meets Visual Novel/RPG in this top down 2D pixel art game. My first game Ive made in 14 years since my freshman DigiPen class... lets try this! 

A lot of free to use and bought assets are used in this project. It is built in Godot 4 and the most notable of the assets are below.
